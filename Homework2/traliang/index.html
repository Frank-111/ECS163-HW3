        <h1>Pokémon Dashboard</h1>
        <p>
            For the Pokémon Dashboard, I chose to explore the statistics of Pokémon using three visualization: 
            stack bar chart, radar chart, and a parallel coordinate plot. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the stacked bar chart, I choose to first give a general overview of the dataset by showing all of the types relative to their generation
          This give us an overview of the different type distributions which tells us which Pokémon are more abudent or scarces. In addition,
          I've added a hover tool to see the count of the total pokémon of the specific type in that generation for more clarity for the user
        </p>
        <p>
            For the next graph, I've added a radar chart to show the stats of the individual pokémon to help to user find the specific pokemon stat. 
            To make the chart feel more relevant I've made sure to make the radar chart relative to their highest stat total so that the polygon drawn doesn't 
            feel weird for the user to see. To make the search easier, I've just created a drop down for the user to choose a specific pokemon
        </p>
        <p>
            For the final chart, I've created a parallel coordinate plot for a more holistic view of the stat comparisons of all pokemon. To help the users focus
            more on a specific pokemon I've gone ahead and added a search bar with an autocomplete function to help the user find a specific pokemon. 
            This will allow the user to see the stat of the pokemon with bolded line to not overwhelm the user with all the colors.
